# User Authentication - Requirements

_NOTE: This is an example and does NOT reflect an actual requirements in this repository._

## Overview

This feature enables secure user authentication for the runtime-code application, allowing users to register, log in, and maintain authenticated sessions.

## User Stories

### Epic: User Account Management

**As a** new user  
**I want to** create an account  
**So that** I can access the application's features

**As a** returning user  
**I want to** log into my account  
**So that** I can access my personalized content and settings

**As a** security-conscious user  
**I want** my account to be protected  
**So that** my data remains secure

## Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

### User Registration

- The system shall accept user registration with email, password, and display name
- The system shall validate that email addresses are in a valid format
- The system shall require passwords to be at least 8 characters long
- The system shall require passwords to contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number
- When a user attempts to register with an existing email, the system shall return an error message
- The system shall send a verification email to the user's email address
- When a user clicks the verification link, the system shall activate their account

### User Login

- The system shall authenticate users using email and password
- When a user provides valid credentials, the system shall return an authentication token
- When a user provides invalid credentials, the system shall return an error message
- If a user fails authentication 3 consecutive times, the system shall temporarily lock the account for 15 minutes
- The system shall maintain user sessions for 24 hours from last activity
- When a user's session expires, the system shall require re-authentication

### Password Security

- The system shall hash passwords using bcrypt with a minimum cost factor of 12
- The system shall never store passwords in plain text
- The system shall never return password information in API responses
- When a user requests a password reset, the system shall send a secure reset link to their email
- The system shall expire password reset links after 1 hour

### Session Management

- The system shall use JWT tokens for session management
- The system shall include user ID and role information in the token payload
- The system shall refresh tokens automatically when they are within 15 minutes of expiration
- When a user logs out, the system shall invalidate their current session token

## Business Requirements

### Performance Requirements

- Login operations shall complete within 500ms under normal load
- The system shall support up to 1000 concurrent users
- Password hashing shall not exceed 100ms per operation

### Security Requirements

- All authentication endpoints shall use HTTPS
- The system shall implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- The system shall log all authentication attempts for security monitoring
- The system shall comply with OWASP authentication guidelines

### Compliance Requirements

- The system shall comply with GDPR requirements for user data handling
- User passwords shall be handled according to NIST password guidelines
- The system shall provide audit trails for all authentication events

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics

- 95% of valid login attempts should succeed within 500ms
- Less than 1% false positive rate for security lockouts
- Email verification completion rate above 80%

### Security Metrics

- Zero successful brute force attacks
- All password storage using approved hashing algorithms
- 100% of authentication traffic over HTTPS

### User Experience Metrics

- User registration completion rate above 90%
- Average time to complete registration under 2 minutes
- User satisfaction score above 4.0/5.0 for authentication flow

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing user database schema
- Must be compatible with current API versioning strategy
- Must support both web and mobile client applications

### Business Constraints

- Feature must be delivered within 4 weeks
- Must not require additional third-party services
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing user accounts

### Assumptions

- Users have access to email for verification
- Users understand basic password security concepts
- HTTPS is available for all client connections

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- User database schema (must be defined)
- Email service for verification and password reset
- Logging and monitoring infrastructure

### External Dependencies

- JWT library for token management
- bcrypt library for password hashing
- Email service provider (if using external service)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Password security vulnerabilities**: Mitigated by using established libraries and security practices
- **Session hijacking**: Mitigated by proper token management and HTTPS requirement

### Medium Risk

- **Email delivery issues**: Mitigated by using reliable email service and retry mechanisms
- **Database performance**: Mitigated by proper indexing and connection pooling

### Low Risk

- **UI/UX complexity**: Mitigated by following established design patterns
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Mitigated by using standard web technologies

## Future Considerations

### Phase 2 Enhancements

- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Social media login integration
- Single Sign-On (SSO) support
- Advanced password policies

### Scalability Considerations

- Distributed session management for multiple servers
- Database sharding for large user bases
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed user data
