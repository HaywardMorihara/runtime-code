# Feature Requirements: Code Execution Proof of Concept

## Overview
A proof of concept for a text-to-code execution system that will eventually evolve into an AI-driven game control mechanism. The initial implementation focuses on a simple web UI that allows users to type JavaScript code, send it to a Node.js server for execution, and display the execution results back in the UI.

**Long-term vision**: Text instructions → LLM → Generated code → Game control in a 2D top-down game

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to type JavaScript code in a web interface so I can test code execution remotely
- As a developer, I want to see console output from executed code so I can verify my code ran correctly
- As a developer, I want a simple local development setup so I can iterate quickly on this concept

## Functional Requirements

### Phase 1 (Current Scope)
1. **Web UI**
   - Simple web interface with a text input/textarea for code entry
   - Submit button to send code to server
   - Display area for execution results/console output
   - Runnable locally in browser

2. **Node.js Server**
   - Accept HTTP requests containing JavaScript code
   - Execute code using `eval()` function
   - Capture console output from executed code
   - Return execution results (success/error + console output) to client
   - Run locally for development

3. **Core Functionality**
   - Execute simple JavaScript code (starting with `console.log("hello world")`)
   - Handle basic errors gracefully
   - Display server-side console output in the UI
   - Display game state as text in the UI
   - Allow executed code to modify game state (for future testing)

### Future Phases (Out of Scope for POC)
- LLM integration for code generation
- Visual 2D game rendering (currently text-based game state)
- Character/game state management with graphics
- Natural language instruction parsing

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: Since using `eval()`, this should only run locally and never be exposed publicly
- **Performance**: Should handle simple code execution with minimal latency
- **Usability**: Simple, intuitive interface for quick testing
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation between UI and server components

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can open web UI in browser
- [ ] User can type `console.log("hello world")` in the UI
- [ ] User can click submit to send code to server
- [ ] Server receives and executes the JavaScript code
- [ ] Server captures console output from executed code
- [ ] UI displays "hello world" output from the server
- [ ] System handles basic syntax errors gracefully
- [ ] Both UI and server can be run locally with simple commands

## Technical Decisions
- **Communication**: WebSockets for real-time output streaming
- **UI Framework**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (simplest for POC)
- **Server**: Basic Node.js with minimal dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Basic error capture, no security sandboxing
- **Output Capture**: All console methods (log, error, warn, etc.)
- **State Management**: Stateless, no code persistence
- **UI Features**: No syntax highlighting, barebones interface

## Dependencies
- Node.js runtime environment
- Web browser
- WebSocket support
- Local development environment

## Constraints
- **Security**: No security considerations - local POC only
- **Scope**: Ultra-simple implementation, will be discarded
- **Environment**: Local development only
- **Complexity**: Favor simplicity over features

## Success Metrics
- Successfully execute `console.log("hello world")` with real-time output
- Code execution appears instantly in UI via WebSocket
- All console output types captured and displayed
- Text-based game state displayed in UI
- Ready for next test: executed code modifying game state display
