# Shared Definitions and Standards

This document contains common definitions, standards, and guidelines that apply across all features and modules in the project.

## üìù Specification Writing Standards

### Requirements Format (EARS - Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)

Use the EARS format for clear, testable requirements:

- **Ubiquitous**: "The system shall [requirement]"
- **Event-driven**: "When [trigger] the system shall [requirement]"
- **Unwanted behavior**: "If [condition] then the system shall [requirement]"
- **State-driven**: "While [state] the system shall [requirement]"
- **Optional**: "Where [feature is included] the system shall [requirement]"

### Example Requirements

```markdown
## User Authentication
- The system shall authenticate users using email and password
- When a user enters invalid credentials, the system shall display an error message
- If a user fails authentication 3 times, the system shall lock the account for 15 minutes
- While a user is logged in, the system shall maintain their session for 24 hours
- Where two-factor authentication is enabled, the system shall require a second factor
```

## üèóÔ∏è Design Standards

### Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component should have a single responsibility
2. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
3. **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification
4. **Interface Segregation**: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface

### Design Documentation Structure

```markdown
# Component Design

## Overview
Brief description of the component's purpose

## Architecture
High-level architecture diagram and explanation

## Data Models
Define all data structures and their relationships

## Interfaces
API contracts and method signatures

## Dependencies
External dependencies and their justification

## Security Considerations
Authentication, authorization, data protection

## Performance Requirements
Expected load, response times, scalability needs

## Error Handling
How errors are detected, reported, and recovered from
```

## ‚úÖ Task Breakdown Standards

### Task Characteristics

Each task should be:
- **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous description
- **Measurable**: Defined completion criteria
- **Achievable**: Realistic given available resources
- **Relevant**: Contributes to the feature goals
- **Time-bound**: Estimated effort and duration

### Task Template

```markdown
## Task: [Brief Description]

**Priority**: High/Medium/Low
**Estimated Effort**: [hours/days]
**Dependencies**: [List of prerequisite tasks]
**Assignee**: [Team member or TBD]

### Description
Detailed description of what needs to be done

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, testable criteria
- [ ] Another criteria
- [ ] Final criteria

### Technical Notes
Any implementation details, gotchas, or considerations

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

## üß™ Testing Standards

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: Test system performance under load
5. **Security Tests**: Test security controls and vulnerabilities

### Test Naming Convention

```
describe('[Component/Feature] - [Scenario]')
it('should [expected behavior] when [conditions]')
```

Example:
```javascript
describe('User Authentication - Login Process')
it('should return success token when valid credentials provided')
it('should throw error when invalid password provided')
it('should lock account when max attempts exceeded')
```

## üìä Common Data Types

### Standard Response Format

```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": any,
  "error": {
    "code": string,
    "message": string,
    "details": any
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": string,
    "version": string,
    "requestId": string
  }
}
```

### Error Codes

| Code | Description | HTTP Status |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Invalid input data | 400 |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | Authentication required | 401 |
| `FORBIDDEN` | Access denied | 403 |
| `NOT_FOUND` | Resource not found | 404 |
| `CONFLICT` | Resource conflict | 409 |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Too many requests | 429 |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Server error | 500 |

## üîß Configuration Standards

### Environment Variables

Use the following naming convention:
- `APP_*`: Application-specific settings
- `DB_*`: Database configuration
- `API_*`: External API settings
- `AUTH_*`: Authentication settings
- `LOG_*`: Logging configuration

### Example Configuration

```env
# Application
APP_NAME=runtime-code
APP_ENV=development
APP_PORT=3000

# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=runtime_code
DB_USER=developer
DB_PASSWORD=secret

# Authentication
AUTH_JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=24h
AUTH_REFRESH_EXPIRY=7d
```

## üìã Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns in the codebase
2. **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting
3. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
4. **Comments**: Explain WHY, not WHAT (the code explains what)

### Documentation Comments

```javascript
/**
 * Authenticates a user with email and password
 * 
 * @param {string} email - User's email address
 * @param {string} password - User's password
 * @returns {Promise<AuthResult>} Authentication result with token
 * @throws {ValidationError} When email format is invalid
 * @throws {AuthenticationError} When credentials are invalid
 */
async function authenticateUser(email, password) {
  // Implementation...
}
```

## üîÑ Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

Follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for all releases:
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Specification Versioning

Specifications should be versioned alongside the code:
- Track changes in version control
- Tag major specification updates
- Maintain backwards compatibility when possible

## üìö Documentation Standards

### API Documentation

Use OpenAPI/Swagger specification for REST APIs:

```yaml
paths:
  /api/users:
    post:
      summary: Create new user
      description: Creates a new user account with the provided information
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateUserRequest'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: User created successfully
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/UserResponse'
```

### User Documentation

Keep user documentation:
- **Task-oriented**: Focus on what users want to accomplish
- **Step-by-step**: Provide clear, actionable instructions
- **Example-rich**: Include practical examples and screenshots
- **Up-to-date**: Review and update regularly
